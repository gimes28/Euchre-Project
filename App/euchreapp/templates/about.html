            <h3 class="ui header">Before Game Start</h3>
            <div class="ui bulleted list">
                <div class="item">A player will continuely deals cards to each person from the deck to determine the
                    first dealer. The desk consists of 9s, 10s, Jacks, Queens, Kings and Aces. The person who receives
                    the first black Jack will be the dealer for the first trick.
                </div>
                <div class="item">The dealer alternates passing out 2 and 3 cards to each person playing. Pass out cards
                    until each person has 5 cards and you have 4 cards remaining in your hand.
                </div>
                <div class="item">The dealer flips the top card to determine the potential trump suit. The trump suit is
                    considered the highest suit of that round.</div>
                <div class="item">
                    Players go around the table once, giving someone the chance to tell the dealer to pick
                    up the flipped-over card (which declares the suit as trump or the highest).
                    <ul>
                        <div>For instance, if you have a handful of diamonds and the flipped card is a high
                            diamond (and if you or your partner are the dealer), you would want to call that card as
                            trump. If you are told by your partner to pick up the card, then you must discard a card
                            from your hand (you can choose, so I would recommend a off-suited low-value card).
                        </div>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="item">
                    If all players pass on the first round, the dealer must flip over the card to prepare for a second
                    round, in which people can arbitrarily call for which suit they want as the trump suit. If all
                    players pass on the second go around, the dealer is forced to choose a suit to be
                    trump.
                </div>
                <div class="item">The “right bower” is the highest card in the trick and the “left bower” is the
                    second-highest card. Both bowers are jacks of the same color, and they depend on which card was
                    called the trump suit. For instance, if hearts are trump for that trick, the right bower would be
                    the jack of hearts and the left bower would be the jack of diamonds.
                    <ul>
                        <div>If a red suit (hearts or diamonds) is called trump, then the black jacks remain at
                            the same hierachy, better than a 9 and 10 but less than a Queen, King and Ace.
                        </div>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
            <h3 class="ui header">Gameplay</h3>
            <div class="ui ordered list">
                <div class="item">The starting player (the person that is left to the dealer) puts down their lead card
                    (this
                    should be the highest card that the player has — preferably in the trump suit). The suit of the card
                    that is
                    led must be followed by the rest of the players.
                    <ul>
                        <div>For example, if a diamond is the suit of the card played, then all other players must
                            “follow
                            suit”
                            and play a diamond if they have it.
                        </div>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="item">If unable to follow suit, players can play any card from their hand. There an be 2
                    things you can do
                    <div class="ui ordered list">
                        <div class="item">
                            You can play a trump card and trump cards win the trick if it is the highest card played. Be
                            aware that other players could also play trump cards that are bigger than yours.
                        </div>
                        <div class="item">If you do you not have a
                            card of the same suit that was lead or don't have a trump card, then you do what is called
                            "throwing off" which is when you throw a low off-suited card that you know can't win but
                            gets low cards out of your hand.
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="item">A team gains points if they win a majority of tricks. For attackers (if your team
                    initially called the trump suit), you gain a point for winning three or four tricks and two points
                    for winning five. For defenders (if the other team called trump), you gain two points if your team
                    wins the at least 3 of the 5 tricks.
                </div>
                <div class="item">Play each trick until you run out of cards then the next dealer is the person to the
                    left of the previous dealer. Continue repeating these steps and when one team reaches 10 points, the
                    game is over and that team is victorious!
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3 class="ui header">Other Rules (Possible Implementation)</h3>
            <div class="ui bulleted list">
                <div class="item">If you have a great hand, you can choose to play this trick alone (“go alone”), which
                    exempts your partner from playing in that trick. “Going alone” can be a good strategy because your
                    team can get 4 points in that trick if you get all of the trick. If you are “Going alone” and don't
                    get all of the tricks, your team will only receive 1 point.
